# Project Overview: AI Content Suite

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal is to develop a web-based application that empowers content creators to generate high-quality, "spicy" (adult-themed or suggestive) images and videos using AI. The platform will be built around a key feature: the ability for a user to create a "Digital Twin" from their own photos, ensuring character consistency across all generated content.

## 2. Target Audience

*   **Independent Content Creators:** Individuals on platforms like OnlyFans, Patreon, Fansly, etc., who need a steady stream of unique, high-quality promotional or exclusive content.
*   **Social Media Influencers:** Influencers in niches where edgy or suggestive content performs well (e.g., cosplay, lingerie modeling, fitness).
*   **Digital Artists & Enthusiasts:** Hobbyists exploring AI art generation with a focus on character creation and adult themes.

## 3. Key Features

| Feature              | Description                                                                                                                           | User Benefit                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Digital Twin**     | Users upload 10-20 photos to train a custom AI model of a person. This model can then be used in subsequent generations.              | Creates consistent, recognizable characters, enabling personalized content.    |
| **Image Generation** | A text-to-image engine with advanced options like negative prompts, aspect ratios, style selection, and NSFW filters.                 | Provides full creative control to generate specific scenes and visuals.        |
| **Video Generation** | A text-to-video or image-to-video tool for creating short, animated clips (3-5 seconds). Ideal for social media teasers or GIFs. | Offers a dynamic content format that is more engaging than static images.     |
| **Gallery & Manager**  | A private, secure gallery for users to view, organize, and download their generated content.                                         | Centralizes asset management and makes it easy to find and reuse content.      |
| **Credit System**      | A pay-as-you-go system where users purchase credits to spend on training Twins, generating images, or creating videos.                 | Provides a clear and flexible monetization model.                               |

## 4. Technology Stack (Proposed)

*   **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript (as per this prototype package).
*   **Backend:** A robust framework like Python (FastAPI/Django) to handle user accounts, job queues, and API requests.
*   **AI Models:** Integration with services like Stable Diffusion (for images) and Stable Video Diffusion (for video), likely running on dedicated GPU servers.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for user data and metadata of generated content.
*   **Storage:** A cloud storage solution like AWS S3 for user-uploaded photos and all generated assets.
